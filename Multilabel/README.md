This method is based on the segmentation of three main components located in the breast area, specifically fat tissue, fibroglandular tissue and pectoral muscle from digitized mammograms. 

In technical terms, thus segmentation is performed using various types of convolutional neural network U-net and this was improved using morphological operators.
