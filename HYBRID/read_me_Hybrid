In this folder you can find the matlab file we used for the implementation of HYBRID algorithm.

You just need to enter the path of the dcm FFDM image and you obtain the breast density segmentation and percentage.


This code was provided by the authors. If you need any specific function (such as 'kmeansfgt'), you could contact them. 

'segBreast', 'ffdmRead', 'getinfo' and 'semanticseg' functions are available at OpenBreast.
