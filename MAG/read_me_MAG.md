## Morphological Area Gradient: System-independent Dense Tissue Segmentation in Mammography Images (MAG)

This algorithm calculates a morphological area function, which is a mesure of the amount of segmented tissue as a function of a threshold value and its derivative called Morphological Area Gradient (_doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857320._).

This folder contains the script used in python for obtaining a segmentation of dense tissue using Morphological Area Gradient algorithm.

We converted this algorithm from matlab coding to python. You could see the original matlab code and needed functions in openBreast repository.
