## Deep Learning-Based Multi-Label Tissue Segmentation and Density Assessment from Mammograms (MULTILABEL)

This algorithm is based on the segmentation of three main components located in the breast area, specifically fat tissue, fibroglandular tissue and pectoral muscle from digitized mammograms.

In this folder you can find the python code we used for implementing the algorithm proposed in "Deep Learning-Based Multi-Label Tissue Segmentation and Density Assessment from Mammograms" paper _(doi: 10.1016/j.irbm.2022.05.004)_.

You can see specific python files (**'data.py'**, **'modelUnetResnet50.py'**), functions and CNNs at the authors repository:
